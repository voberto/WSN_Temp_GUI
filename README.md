# WSN_Temp_GUI
ESP8266/ESP32 Temperature Measurement Wireless Sensor Node (+DS18B20) with Graphical User Interface program.

### 1 - Overview

This project comprises a full HW/SW minimal design for the ESP8266 Node MCU board to send periodic measurements from the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor to a Python-based graphical user interface program through mosquitto MQTT broker. A general block diagram of the included parts is depicted below.
